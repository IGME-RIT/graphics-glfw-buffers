Description:
This program serves to demonstrate rendering with buffers, using two Texture Buffers 
(which are essentially 1d Textures or arrays of data) for Vertex and Index data. 
The mesh drawn is loaded from a .obj export from Blender (there are comments in 
the .obj file too!). The buffers are passed in as uniform samplerBuffers, and 
are accessed via texelFetch (VertexID determines which index in the index buffer to use, 
and that value is then used to texelFetch from the vertex buffer).

	out_color = color; // Set our out_color equal to our in color, basically making this a pass-through shader.
